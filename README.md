# TechShortsApp — Calm Tech. Fast.

Welcome to **TechShortsApp**, a focused short-video platform built exclusively for developers, creators, and tech learners who value clarity over chaos.

## 🚀 Why TechShortsApp?

In a world full of memes, dances, and distractions, tech creators have no dedicated space to grow.  
That’s why I built **TechShortsApp** — a calm place for developers to share ideas in 90 seconds or less.

> **No noise. No chasing trends. Just pure tech — shared in short, meaningful clips.**

## 🧱 What is TechShortsApp?

A self-funded experiment — built from personal savings, between jobs and night shifts, while studying in the U.S. as a full-time international student.

- Upload short tech videos
- Filter by tech stack (JS, Python, etc.)
- Scroll-based feed, like Reels/Shorts
- Built for fast learning, not virality
